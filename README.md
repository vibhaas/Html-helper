# Html Helper

HTML Helper was an app created with the aim of helping people write HTML code(especially in my school) and because I wanted to write in my own editor!

## Installation

* To install using `npm`, download the `.zip` file and extract the `Html Helper` folder, then run:-
```
npm install
```
* Followed by `npm run package-win` or `npm run package-mac` or `npm run package-linux` depending on your OS.
* The resulting files in the `release-builds` folder can be executed

## Web Version

This can be run straight in the browser - to do so, extract the `.zip` file and run `index.html` or use it straight from Github here: [https://vibhaas.github.io/Html-Helper](https://vibhaas.github.io/Html-Helper)

## Tech/Frameworks
* This app is made with HTML, CSS and JS. It implements [Ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/), Materialize, Material Icons and Jquery.
* The desktop app is written in [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)(Nodejs)
